<h1>.o Propagation</h1>
<p>On March 23, 2019, the .o zone was reset following a new serial format, which is lower than the previous serial.<br />
   All correctly configured servers picked up the new serial correctly, but some are still serving cached versions of the old zone.</p>
<p>If you are a Tier 2 server operator, please update your configuration to grab the .o zone from ns11.opennic.glue.</p>
<p>If you need assistance, email <a href="mailto:jonah@opennic.org">jonah@opennic.org</a>.</p>
