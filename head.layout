<h1>ModernTLD Propagation Status</h1>
<p><strong>.o Notice - March 23, 2019</strong> The .o zone has been reset following a new serial format, which is lower than the previous serial.<br />
   This is a two step process. The first step involves raising the serial to 4166515648.</br />
   All correctly configured servers picked up the new serial correctly, but some are still serving cached versions of the old zone.<br />
   Next, once a majority of servers pick up the new serial, the serial will be reset to 1553448687.<br />
   This reset should work automatically, because BIND is designed to wrap around serials when the maximum value is reached.</p>
<p>If you are a Tier 2 server operator, please update your configuration to grab the .o zone from ns11.opennic.glue.<br />
   <strong>Your serial should not be 2019032001 or older!</strong></p>
